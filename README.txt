Shine2D is a basic Open-GL based 2D graphics library for Java. It implements much of the same functionality as the Graphics2D library that ships with the standard JDK (and some additional features, to be improved and extended in the future) while offering dramatic performance improvements over its closed-source counterpart.

Shine features a variety of drawing modes including alpha blending (normal mode), add, multiply and screen, as well as alpha map to transfer the alpha channel from one image to another. It can also draw lines (with patterns and phase, fairly similar to Graphics2D), shapes and images with scaling, rotation and symmetric reflection.

Currently only the LWJGL version works, and it only half-works at that. Render-to-texture seems to be broken for GL11 in LWJGL2.9.3, while rendering to the window buffer is additionally broken in 3.x. I'm not to the point where I can implement shaders yet and there's still some basic functionality that needs implementing and/or fixing, so no releases yet.

License Info: TBA. "Free and Open Source"ù is a given, and I intend to use a license with terms that are favorable for whoever wants to use it in their ProjectX (and whatever terms that may imply, commercial or otherwise).
