Shine2D is a basic Open-GL based 2D graphics library for Java. It implements much of the same functionality as the Graphics2D library that ships with the standard JDK (and some additional features, to be improved and extended in the future) while offering dramatic performance improvements over its closed-source counterpart.

Shine features a variety of drawing modes including alpha blending (normal mode), add, multiply and screen, as well as alpha map to transfer the alpha channel from one image to another. It can also draw lines (with patterns and phase, fairly similar to Graphics2D), shapes and images with scaling, rotation and symmetric reflection.

The LWJGL 3.0 version is now fully working, although the features are fairly basic. There is also a simple test/example program demonstrating basic usage.
