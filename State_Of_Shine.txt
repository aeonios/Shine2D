So far I’ve stripped all the non-graphics stuff out of slick and fixed all the obvious interface incompatibilities between it and the latest lwjgl. I also created the SWindow class to wrap glfw’s crappy window interface.

Things that need doing:
-Graphics/FBOGraphics is not managing the GL Context/Capabilities correctly. It won’t work until that’s fixed.

-SWindow needs a proper getGraphics handle and some sort of simple interface for swapping its buffers after drawing. It could probably use other features to include more of what glfw can do, but right now that’s not so high priority.

-ImageBuffer should be merged into Image, because getting an Image is the only thing that ImageBuffer is used for. I don’t know if Image supports setting individual pixels but if not then that should just be merged too.

-Getting a GL Context/Capabilities without creating a window first would be nice. Creating a window should not be necessary for drawing to offscreen buffers.
